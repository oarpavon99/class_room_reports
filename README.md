# Google Classroom Grade Reports

This project helps teachers that use Google Classroom to send grade reports to both students and guardians. 

It has two main functionalities: Missing tasks and Grade Reports. The Missing tasks will look for activities that students in a class are missing and send a report to students or parents. The Grade Report will send a current grade report for all the students in a class.
